# Download images from each plate from the NF1 Schwann cell project

In this module, we download the images and platemap metadata for each plate from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), which is a open-source repository that holds data/figures/etc. to preserve and share. 

## Step 1: Access the project on Figshare

To access the plates, go to the [NF1 Schwann Cell Genotype Cell Painting Assay](https://figshare.com/projects/NF1_Schwann_Cell_Genotype_Cell_Painting_Assay/161620).

## Step 2: Download the images and metadata from each plate

To download the images in a plate, click on the plate and then click `Download all`. 
We recommend extracting the downloaded zip file into this repository so that the downstream modules will have access to the images and metadata.
For this project, each folder is named `Plate_1` and `Plate_2` containing the respective files.
